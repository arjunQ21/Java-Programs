Different Event Objects in Java
===============================
Event Objects are created by awt itself when different actions occur on the components being rendered.

On the basis of occurred events, the respective event objects are created.
For example, when an user clicks a button, **ActionEvent** object is created.

All event objects have these methods available:

    EventObject.getSource() ;
    EventObject.toString() ;
